Git
The command git checkout -b <branchname> is used to create and switch to a new branch in Git. It is a shortcut for the following two commands:

git branch <branchname>: This creates a new branch with the given name.
git checkout <branchname>: This switches the current working branch to the new branch.
The new branch will be based on the current branch or the specified start point. For example, if you want to create a new branch called feature from the master branch, you can use:

git checkout -b feature master
This command is useful when you want to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main branch. You can find more information about this command and its options in the Git documentation or in these web tutorials123.
